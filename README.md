# GraceNote XMLTV Scraper

Generate XMLTV guide data from GraceNote/TMS listings for use with Jellyfin, Plex, Emby, TVHeadend, and other DVR/IPTV software.

## Features

- Scrapes 14 days of GraceNote/TMS program listings and outputs standard XMLTV format
- Enriches programs with TMDB poster images, ratings, descriptions, and release dates
- Enriches channel icons via the [tv-logo/tv-logos](https://github.com/tv-logo/tv-logos) project
- Runs as a long-lived server with automatic 24-hour refresh, or as a one-shot scrape for cron jobs
- First-run ZIP/postal-code setup with cable, satellite, and over-the-air lineup selection
- Guide data cached on disk — fast restarts without re-scraping
- Automatic XMLTV file rotation with 7-day retention
- Optional Jellyfin Live TV integration with in-browser streaming
- Optional channel filter to limit guide output to Jellyfin-available channels
- Bonus: built-in retro TV guide web UI ("The Grid")

## Jellyfin / Plex Setup

1. Run the scraper in server mode (see below).
2. Open `http://<your-host>:8080/setup` and choose your provider lineup.
3. When the first guide finishes building, click the XMLTV guide URL on the setup page to copy it, or add this equivalent URL to your DVR software:
   ```
   http://<your-host>:8080/xmlguide.xmltv
   ```
4. Guide data refreshes automatically every 24 hours.

Alternatively, use `--guide-only` mode with a cron job and point your DVR software at the local `xmlguide.xmltv` file.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/daniel-widrick/GraceNoteScraper.git
   cd GraceNoteScraper
   ```

2. Copy the environment file for optional integrations:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Optionally add a TMDB token, Jellyfin settings, or legacy GN_* settings
   ```

3. Start the container:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open `http://<your-host>:8080/setup`, enter your ZIP or postal code, and choose a provider lineup.

5. After the first guide finishes building, click the XMLTV guide URL shown on the setup page to copy it into your DVR software.

Setup, guide data, caches, and images are persisted in a Docker volume. The container restarts automatically and refreshes guide data every 24 hours.

To view logs:
```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

To rebuild after pulling updates:
```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose, **or** Go 1.25+ for building from source
- (Optional) A [TMDB API read access token](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) for poster images and metadata

## Building from Source

If you prefer to run without Docker:

```sh
go build -o gracenotescraper .
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env
./gracenotescraper
```

### Scrape-only mode

Scrapes once, writes `xmlguide.xmltv` to the working directory, and exits. Useful for cron-based setups where you don't need the server running.

Run server mode once to save a provider through `/setup`, or provide complete legacy `GN_*` settings, before using this mode.

```sh
./gracenotescraper --guide-only
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Saved non-secret setup configuration | `config.json` |
| `GN_HEADEND` | Legacy/bootstrap GraceNote headend ID; use with `GN_LINEUP` and `GN_ZIPCODE` | — |
| `GN_LINEUP` | Legacy/bootstrap full lineup string | — |
| `GN_COUNTRY` | Country code | `USA` |
| `GN_ZIPCODE` | Legacy/bootstrap ZIP or postal code | — |
| `GN_LANGUAGE` | Language code | `en-us` |
| `GN_DEVICE` | Device identifier | `-` |
| `TMDB_TOKEN` | TMDB read access token (optional) | — |
| `BASE_URL` | Server base URL — rewrites XMLTV image URLs to use the built-in proxy cache (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:8080`) | — |
| `PORT` | HTTP server port | `8080` |
| `JELLYFIN_URL` | Jellyfin server URL (optional — enables live TV integration) | — |
| `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` | Jellyfin API key | — |
| `JELLYFIN_CHANNEL_FILTER` | Set to any non-empty value to filter guide to only Jellyfin-available channels. Requires `JELLYFIN_URL` and `JELLYFIN_API_KEY`. | — |

A saved `CONFIG_PATH` selection takes precedence over legacy `GN_*` settings. Delete or move that file if you intentionally want to bootstrap from environment settings again.

## HTTP Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /setup` | Choose or change the active provider lineup |
| `GET /api/setup/config` | Read the current non-secret lineup selection |
| `GET /api/setup/providers?postalCode=...` | Find Gracenote lineups for an area |
| `POST /api/setup/provider` | Save the selected provider and queue a fresh guide |
| `GET /xmlguide.xmltv` | XMLTV guide data (point your DVR here) |
| `GET /api/guide.json` | Guide data as JSON |
| `GET /` | The Grid — built-in web UI |
| `GET /img?url=...` | Image proxy with local cache |
| `GET /api/livetv/config` | Returns `{"enabled":true/false}` — whether Jellyfin live TV is configured |
| `GET /api/livetv/channels` | Proxies Jellyfin channel list (requires `JELLYFIN_URL` and `JELLYFIN_API_KEY`) |
| `GET /api/livetv/tune?id=<channelId>` | Starts a live stream for the given channel and returns an HLS URL |
| `POST /api/livetv/stop` | Forwards a playback-stop notification to Jellyfin to end a live stream |

## The Grid

The server includes a built-in retro-styled TV guide web UI at the root URL. If no provider is configured, `/` redirects to `/setup`. Once configured, the guide auto-scrolls through your channel lineup and shows program details, posters, and metadata. Handy for a quick glance at what's on without opening your DVR app.
